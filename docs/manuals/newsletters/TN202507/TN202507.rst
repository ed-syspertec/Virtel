Whatâ€™s new in Virtel 4.63 Beta Release
====================================

The following newsletter summaries the new features and maintenance updates that can be found in Virtel Release 4.63 Beta at update level 6200. 

New features
------------

Connectivity Enhancements: TN3270 Client
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- The Virtel server now integrates a TN3270 client which enables Telnet bounces towards other Telnet servers such as remote z/OS systems, z/VM systems, OSA-ICC Consoles, IBMi systems (AS400), TPF etc. This is further documented in the Virtel Connectivity Guide (Section - TN3270 Lines)

Security Enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- The Virtel SSO Gateway allows external authentication (AD, OIDS, SAML...) to Mainframe applications for end-users, allowing them to connect to Mainframe applications using their Windows/AD password.
- The Virtel session tokens have been re-engineered, in order to be harder to hack
- It is now possible to set customized HTTP Security Headers (Strict Transport Security, etc.)for all pages and files served by the Virtel web server. This allows the Virtel web server to be compliant with the most recent security standards.

UX Enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Improved support for the TSO OMVS application. The command line is now preserved when the screen is refreshed.

.. note::

    This feature is disabled by default in the 4.63 Beta release.

Administration Enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- New administrator panel to kill active Virtel sessions
- Search field introduced on several panels, to improve management of large configurations
- Simplified CSS customization for creation of new colour schemes
- New LU Nailing feature, integrated into the Virtel ARBO file (no longer relies on RACF groups)

Migration considerations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**End of support for COMPATIBILITY mode**

The "COMPATIBILITY" mode for w2hparm, that was introduced in version 4.54 to provide seamless migration of V4.53 w2hparm to V4.54. w2hparm is no longer supported from V4.61 onwards. It is recommended to switch to "Option" mode before migrating later releases.

**6046 DCB value of STATS file changed to 255**

This was increased to 255 in Virtel 4.61. Reallocate any STATS file with a LRECL=255,RECFM=VB,BLKSIZE=4096

**Version support**

Virtel versions V4.59 and older are no longer supported. It is recommended to migrate to the latest GA release.

**ARBO changes**

- There have been no changes to the ARBO which would require specific migration actions from v4.60 and upwards.

Introduce a new VIRTERM parameter HDRSEC, and two new macros HDRH and HDRD based on the model of ZAPD/ZAPH. 

Syntax is as follows ::
	
	HDRSEC=(hdrtable,[HIDESERVER]),
	
*hdrtable* - name of a table added to the end of the VIRTCT allowing for one or more HTTP headers to be added to files returned by the Virtel HTTP server. The table is built using the HDRH and HDRD macros. HDRH defines the table, and repeated HDRD entries define all the HTTP headers that should be added.
	
*HIDESERVER* - 	If this option is specified, the HTTP header "Server: Virtel 4.xx" will not be added to files returned by the Virtel HTTP server.
	
Example :: 
	
    VIRTERM  TYPE=INITIAL,                                          X
	[...]
             HDRSEC=(MYHDRTAB,HIDESERVER),                          X
	[...]
	
	MYHDRTAB HDRH
	         HDRD 'X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff'
	         HDRD 'X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN'
	         HDRD 'X-Download-Options: noopen'
	         HDRD 'Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000'

Protecting business assets
==========================

In this newsletter we discuss how to protect access to business assets
using Virtel rules. In this scenario with have two types of business
assets or applications. The first type is the production assets which
are protected by LDAP and use SSO to facilitate security and automatic
logon without the user having to specify a userid and password. The
other type of business asset is a standard application, like TSO or
CICS, which requires the user to enter a userid and password when the
application is accessed. LDAP and SSO are not discussed in this
newsletter. There may be alternatives to this SSO setup but for our
scenario we are assuming two types of asset â€“ secure (requiring no
application logon) and insecure (application logon required). The
scenario utilizes a proxy server to load balance across the Virtel
instances.

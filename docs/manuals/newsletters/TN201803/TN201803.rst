What’s new in Virtel 4.58 (Sept. 2018)
======================================

The following newsletter itemises the updates that can be found in Virtel Release 4.58. 

Installation changes
--------------------


**Customization - OPTION Mode is now default**

As of Virtel 4.58 the transactions to support compatibility have been deprecated and are no longer installed by default. These transactions have been moved to the COMPAT section in the ARBOLOAD JCL deck. The transactionsa are:- 

::
  
      TRANSACT ID=W2H-03CH
      TRANSACT ID=W2H-03CC
      TRANSACT ID=W2H-03CJ
      TRANSACT ID=CLI-03CH
      TRANSACT ID=CLI-03CC
      TRANSACT ID=CLI-03CJ

Virtel 4.58 delivers a dummy w2hparm.js file in the W2H-DIR directory, identified by transaction W2H-03P, and also in the CLI-DIR, identified bu the transaction CLI-03P. New customers are advised to use the 'option' mode support for customization. See below for further details on the 'Option' mode and where to find more information. The ARBOLOAD JCL has been modified to include the OPTION mode transactions by default. To include compatibility mode transactions specify COMPAT=YES in the ARBOLOAD JCL.

**USERPARM**

A new section has been added to the ARBOLOAD to add the transactions required for the USERPARM support. By default these are not added to the ARBO. Specify USERPARM=YES in the ARBOLOAD JCL to include these transactions in your configuration.

Migration considerations
------------------------

Option mode and Compatibility mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As of Virtel 4.56 two modes of customisation are available, the ‘option mode’ and the older ‘compatibility’ mode. The new ‘option’ mode enables better granularity in setting options and customization. As of Virtel V4.56 this is the preferred mode for Virtel customisation. By default, neither mode is active. Certain steps must be followed to activate either "compatibility" or "option" mode. As distributed Virtel will use programmatically set defaults and search for customization elements from the W2H directories. See the default transactions shipped with Virtel for custom.js, custom.css, w2hparm.js elements.  

The previous “Compatibility “ mode is still supported. But requires users to re-assemble their TCTs with the ‘Option-default-compatibility’ keyword in the TCT. This will maintain previous customised behaviour for the custom.css, w2hparm.js and custom.js files.

*TCT keyword for compatibility mode*

::
 
 	HTSETn = (OPTION-DEFAULT-COMPATIBILITY) /* n = 1-4 */

The new “option” mode enables customization at a transaction level as well as the more global entry point or line level. The logic of using CLI-DIR to store customised versions of custom.js, w2hparm.js, custom.css etc. in the CLI-DIR has been deprecated as of release V4.56. To operate in "option mode" requires changes to the ARBO file with the additional of two new transactions to support the "option" pathname. See the ARBOLOAD (Option=YES) or ARBOMIGR in the SAMPLIB file for details on how to include these new transactions. 

Customers are advised to migrate old customisation elements to the new “option” mode enabling those elements to be located through the use of the /option/ pathname. Two new transactions have been added to support the /option/ pathname. See the 'Option Mode' section in **Customizing Virtel** in the Virtel User Guide and the Virtel Technical Newsletter **TN2016-11 Customising Virtel in V4.56**.

.. danger:: Customers who have customized elements in the W2H-DIR stand the risks of having these overwritten by subsequent maintenance and Virtel release updates.

SAMPLIB additions
-----------------

New members have been added to SAMPLIB to support the VIRPLEX configuration. These members are:-

::    

      VIRPLEX     A sample job to configure Virtel to support Virplex
      VIRTELZ     A STC procedure to support the Virtel Reader and Writer instances
      VIRTCT00    A sample TCT for Reader tasks
      VIRTCT99    A sample TCT for Writer tasks
      SPVIREnn    JCL samples to run Virplex instances as batch jobs.

For further information see the Virtel Technical newsletter **TN2018-08 Virplex**      

Presentation
------------

**5534 Help Pages for Version 2 W2H**

New help pages have been added for the Version 2 of VWH settings.

**5539 Show/Hide Virtel tool bar**

A new administrator option has been added to the w2hparm. Setting w2hparm option  ["switchToolBarDisplay"] to a Boolean false or true will hide or display the Virtel context tool bar menu. The default is true.

**5542 Improved VWA Settings messages**

The help messages for the VWA Settings panel have been enhanced.

**5553/5571/5572 Support system clipboard events**

Virtel now supports the system browsers clipboard API. This avoids the need for �Plugin� support in most browsers. This includes support for paste continue and copy append. 

**5608 Allow PA3 to be mapped as PGUP**

The PA3 key can now be mapped to PGUP.

**5654/5655 Presentation Enhancements**

Corrections to the Cross-Hair cursor positioning in large screen sizes (62*160). The Virtel Cut, Copy and Paste feature can now support macro definitions. This change only applies to cases where Virtel is using its own clipboard interface.
Improvements to the font size stretching computing algorithm. 

**5615 Japanese Template Support**

A new Virtel template WEB2VIRTJ.htm has been introduced to provide support for Japanese.

**5619 Add support for Iranian "Farsi"**

The code page IBM1097A Iranian "Farsi" is now supported.

**5631 Add support for "Old Belgium"**
The code page IBM0274 "Old Belgium" is now supported.

**5654/5655/5698 Presentation Enhancements**

Corrections to the Cross-Hair cursor positioning in large screen sizes (62*160). The Virtel Cut, Copy and Paste feature can now support macro definitions. This change only applies to cases where Virtel is using its own clipboard interface.

Improvements to the font size stretching computing algorithm.

Selection box in wrong position in non stretch mode

**5697 Correct invalid 403 signon suspend message**

Invalide template was being displayed when signing on with invalid credentials.

Base Components
---------------

**5530 Change attributes of message VIR009I**

Message VIR0099I will always be written to the syslog to aid in detecting a �Virtel UP� event for automation software.

**5549 Session setup can now accept URL LOGMODE string less than 8 characters**

A logmode less than eight characters can now be passed in the URL string.

**5552 Add CodePage 437 support to IND$FILE**

The IND$FILE file transfer can now support code page 437 (PC-DOS) 

**5559 Update the IBM 0276 Code page**
The IBM EBCDIC French-Canada code page has been updated.

**5566 Default MAXSOCKETS increased to 5000**

The default MAXSOCKETS value has been increased from 250 to 5000 sockets.

**5589 Implement ASYNC NOLONGPOLL using SNASTAT**

Enhancements to the 'nolongpoll' option through implementing a classic poll whenever the SNASTAT indicator is detected (e.g. The application has not freed the keyboard). This should allow normal asynchronous support for most applications and removes the overhead of using an additional  �longpoll� session.
No changes are necessary to Virtel to support this enhancement. I4WEB, however, should be changed to support the SNASTAT indicator to indicate that the application message is incomplete.

Note:-
- Asynchronous events such as 'end of an application' will not be seen by SNASTAT and consequently will not be detected until the operator action i.e. Enter key pressed.

**5599 Set Initial timeout increased**

The Virtel {{{SET-INITIAL-TIMEOUT "10"}}} template instruction has been modified to a time of 101 from 10. This enables a longer session setup time before termination is triggered.  

**5607/5617 3270 Structured field to allow a CICS transaction to obtain TLS user certificate.**

Support for FAC2 structured field which allows a CICS program to retrieve the TTLS user certificate. For VSE requires a compatible release of VSE TCP/IP which supports EZASMI IOCTL requests. See Barnard Software Build IPv6/VSE BUILD 258PRE10. Virtel introduces a new structured field which can be used to extract security credentials. The new structured field is x'FAC2'. See Appendix A for further details.

**5635 Provide a LOGFILE feature for VSE**

By setting LOG=FILE or LOG=SYSOUT in the TCT VSE users can now spool the VIRTEL log to a file or SYSLST dataset. In previous versions the Virtel log was only available through the console. See Appendix B for further details. 

Virtel Web Administration
-------------------------

**5630/5654 Save user settings data on the host**

This feature secures user parameter setting information on the host within the Virtel. When a user refreshes their cache or uses a different machine/browser to access Virtel the users stored settings data will be downloaded from the mainframe. If there is no USERPARM transaction associated with a particular entry point then this feature will be disabled. See Appendix C for further details.

**5649 Hotspots**

Virtel hotspot code has been reworked. It is now possible to add customized hotspots. Please contact Syspertec support for further information on hotspot customization.

**5649 VWA API** 

In this release a VWA API has been implemented. Details can be found in Appendix D.

**5622 Redesign JavaScript initialization**
The initialization of the Virtel JavaScript browser client has been enhanced.

Scenario Language
-----------------

**5576 IF$ now supports OIA-STATUS-INHIBITED**

The IF$ scenario statement has been updated to include option �OIA-STATUS-IS-INHIBITED�.  This can be used to test whether the OIA mode is in X-SYSTEM.

IF$ OIA-STATUS-IS-INHIBITED,THEN=...,ELSE=...

**5577 Update to COPY$ to support multiple fields.**

COPY$ has been updated to support multiple fields. The NUMBER-OF value and SCREEN-INPUT-FIELDS/SCREEN-FIELDS can be used within a scenario to process multiple fields in a template. This feature can be useful in translation of HOD HA scripts to a Virtel scenarios.

::

      HASCRIPT Example:-

            <numfields number="2" optional="false" invertmatch="false" />
            <numinputfields number="2" optional="false" invertmatch="false" />       

Which allows checking if a screen has two fields total and two input-fields.

In Virtel:-

Scenario Example

::
      COPY$ SYSTEM-TO-VARIABLE,VAR='VAR1',          
            FIELD=(NUMBER-OF,SCREEN-INPUT-FIELDS)   
                                                
      COPY$ SYSTEM-TO-VARIABLE,VAR='VAR1',          
            FIELD=(NUMBER-OF,SCREEN-FIELDS)

Template Example

::

      {{{NUMBER-OF (SCREEN-INPUT-FIELDS)}}}

      {{{NUMBER-OF (SCREEN-FIELDS)}}}

**5580 ACTION$ SEND= and KEY=**

Enhancement to the ACTION$ TO-APPLICATION instruction to

* Allow user friendly KEY= keyword values
* Add a new SEND= parameter which can contain data to be copied to the screen before transmitting. 

Example 1:

::

   ACTION$  TO-APPLICATION,KEY=pf18,            
         SEND='s',SCREEN=(23,79),              
         AND=(PROCESS-RESPONSE)       


Example 2:

::

      ACTION$  TO-APPLICATION,
         SEND='[delete][tab]s[pf18]',SCREEN=(23,79),              
         AND=(PROCESS-RESPONSE)                 
          


The KEY= parameter was previously restricted to the low level one byte code for the pf key. It may now also have an uppercase or lowercase mnemonic for the function key (not mixed case).

For example:

  pf2 or PF2 or 'pf2' or F2 are all valid. Previously only F2 was valid.

Also valid are : pa1, PA1, clear, CLEAR, attn, ATTN etc. As an example, the following idnode://8642HASCRIPT example:-

::

      <actions>
      <mouseclick row="9" col="2" />
      <input value="s[pf18]" row="0" col="0" movecursor="true"  xlatehostkeys="true" encrypted="false" />
      </actions> 

Could be translated into a Virtel scenario:

::

      ACTION$ TO-APPLICATION,SEND='s[pf18]',                        * 
              SCREEN=(9,2),AND=(PROCESS-RESPONSE)

Or, you could replace a HASCRIPT statement with encrypted="true" :-

::

        <actions>
            <mouseclick row="11" col="20" />
            <input value="UNz6xMt6Qr8=" row="0" col="0" movecursor="true" xlatehostkeys="true" encrypted="true" />
        </actions>

With a Virtel scenario using a PassTicket:

::

         COPY$ SYSTEM-TO-VARIABLE,VAR='MYPTK',                         *
               FIELD=(NEW-PASSTICKET-FOR-TRANSACTION,MYTRAN)
         COPY$ VARIABLE-TO-SCREEN,VAR='MYPTK',SCREEN=(11,20)
         ACTION$ TO-APPLICATION,KEY=enter,                             *
               AND=(PROCESS-RESPONSE)

**5583 INPUT/OUTPUT SCENARIO Enhancement**

The same scenario can now be used as both input and output scenario types.

**5610 $MAP instruction can now support a label**

$MAP can now be referenced via a labels allowing $MAP instructions to be defined in scenario sub routines.

Appendix B
----------

**LOGFILE Support**

LOG=FILE

A LOGFILE must be set up prior to starting Virtel and the TCT should specify LOG=FILE. The recommendations are:-

::

      FILE ID:			VIRTEL.Vnnn.LOGFILE		FILE NAME: LOGFILE
      ORG:			 5 (SAM EDS) 			USAGE: 2 (REUSE)
      RECORD FORMAT: 	4 VB
      AVG. RECORD SIZE:	165
      MAX. RECORD SIZE:	32000  

In the VIRTEL startup JCL add the following statements to support the LOGFILE:-

::

      // DLBL SYS001,'VIRTEL.V458.LOGFILE',,VSAM,                            X
                  CAT=SYSPUC1,DISP=(NEW,KEEP,DELETE)                       

      At the follow step at the end of the startup JCL to process the log:-

      // EXEC LISTLOG                                                          
      /*                                                                       
      // DLBL PRINTFL,'VIRTEL.V458.LOGFILE',,VSAM,                           X 
                  CAT=SYSPUC1,DISP=(OLD,DELETE,DELETE)                      
      // EXEC IDCAMS,SIZE=AUTO                                                 
      PRINT INFILE (PRINTFL) -                                                
            CHARACTER                                                         
      /*                                                                       

LOG=SYSOUT

For LOG=SYSOUT add the following statement to the Virtel startup JCL:-

::

      // ASSGN SYS002,SYSLST 

VSE LOG Commands

The following commands are available to control the Virtel log:-

::

      MSG XX,DATA=	LOG,D			Display logging status
                        LOG=CONSOLE	Switch to console mode only			
                        LOG=SYSOUT		Switch to sysout mode only

Note.

Once you switched from LOG=FILE(Initial TCT Option) to LOG=CONSOLE, you cannot revert back to LOG=FILE.

Appendix C
----------

**TCT Parameter Changes**

::

      UPARMS=(USERPARM),		Name of directory for user data - USERPARM

If setting up a separate physical VSAM file for the USERPARM directory, the following TCT definitions must be defined, otherwise, use the HTMLTRSF as your USERPARM repository. 

Additional TCT statements required to add a new VSAM TRSF file to support USERPARM:-

::

      UFILE3=(USERTRSF,ACBH3,0,10,05),   VSAM File for USERPARM. DDNAME=USERTRSF


Also add an ACB to support new directory file at the bottom of the TCT definitions:-

::

      ACBH3    ACB   AM=VSAM,DDNAME=USERTRSF,MACRF=(SEQ,DIR),             *
                  STRNO=3                                                           

**ARBO Changes**

To support this feature a new subdirectory and associated transactions are added. The USERPARM member in VIRTEL.SAMPLIB provides an example of the transactions that are required to support the USERPARM feature. Running the ARBOLOAD JCL in the CNTL file with USERPARM=YES will add the relevant entries to the ARBO.:

::

      1. Allocate a new TRSF VSAM file for USERPARM definitions. See USERPARM member in SAMPLIB.
      2. Run ARBOLOAD(CNTL) with USERPARM=YES to allocate a new SUB-DIR and add the associated transactions.
      3. Update the TCT. See above.
      4. Restart Virtel.                                

Note. The HTMLTRSF can also be used as a USERPARM repository. It is not necessary to set up a separate physical VSAM file. Also, take care that the name given to the directory, USERPARM in this case, is correctly referenced by all components.

**Scenario and Template updates**

To access the name of the parameter directory:-

Scenario

::

        COPY$ SYSTEM-TO-VARIABLE,VAR='PRMDIR',  
              FIELD=(NAME-OF,USER-PARMS-DIRECTORY)    

Template

::

     {{{NAME-OF (USER-PARMS-DIRECTORY)}}}

**Security**

The following security definitions will be needed to support this feature. For example, for RACF the following FACILITY profile definitions need to be added and users given READ access.

::

      RDEF FACILITY VIRTEL.USERPARM UACC(NONE)     /* Directory */   
      PE VIRTEL.USERPARM CL(FACILITY) RESET                 
      PE VIRTEL.USERPARM CL(FACILITY) ACC(READ) ID(SPGPTECH)
      RDEF FACILITY VIRTEL.W2H-74 UACC(NONE)       /* UPLOAD */
      PE VIRTEL.W2H-74 CL(FACILITY) RESET                  
      PE VIRTEL.W2H-74 CL(FACILITY) ACC(READ) ID(SPGPTECH)

**Sanity check**

 A 'sanity check' template is provided to validate the USERPARM environment at the transaction level. For example:-

 ::

      http://myVirtel.com:myPort/w2h/checkCentralizedSettings.htm+myTransaction

**Testing**

To test the feature:

::

      1. logon to a 3270 application, say TSO
      2. Open the settings dialog
      3. Change the "Display Style" to Gray and save. The back ground colour should change to gray.
      4. Disconnect from Virtel using the Red button in the tool bar.
      5. Reconnect in another browser and open a 3270 session.
      6. The background colour should still be set to gray.
      7. Open the settings dialogue and confirm that Gray button is still highlighted.

In the console log you should see an 'UPLOAD' message:-

::

      13.47.18 JOB03449  VIRU122I DEVTA014 FILE UPLOAD : ENTRY POINT 'WEB2HOST' DIRECTORY 'USERP  139
      139             ARM' USER 'SPTHOLT             '                                            
      139                    FILE : 'CAB2755C7863A11EF8031C73FB634E9C'   


**Scenario enhancements**

The Virtel scenario and template languages have been enhanced to support this feature. To obtain the name of the User directory

In a scenario:

::
        COPY$ SYSTEM-TO-VARIABLE,VAR='PRMDIR',  
              FIELD=(NAME-OF,USER-PARMS-DIRECTORY)    

In a template:

::

     {{{NAME-OF (USER-PARMS-DIRECTORY)}}}


Appendix D
----------

The VWA API supports the following methods:-

*vwaAPI.getApplicationName* 

A method that returns the application name:-

::
      var n = vwaAPI.getApplicationName();

*vwaAPI.getUserId*

A method that returns the user id:-

::

      var u = vwaAPI.getUserId();

*vwaAPI.submitForm* 

A method that submits the current VWA form with the pf key given as parameter.

::

      vwaAPI.submitForm('PF3'); 

*vwaAPI.customizeBuildTitle*

A method that takes a customized way of building the title into account. You define a function (e.g. myTitleBuilder) that returns a string (=the title). You provide this function as parameter:-

::

      vwaAPI.customizeBuildTitle (myTitleBuilder);

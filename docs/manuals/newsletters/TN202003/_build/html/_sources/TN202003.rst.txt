What’s new in Virtel 4.60 GA Release
=====================================================

The following newsletter summaries the new features and maintenance updates that can be found in Virtel Release 4.60. 

Installation changes
--------------------

**5825 VSE tape - add missing SCRNAPI macros to sublib**

- Updated VSE installation tape with missing SCRNAPI macros

**5832 V4.60 Installation updates**

- Updated MVS and VSE installation tapes with new JCL for v4.60

**5865/5884 complete VSE and FSE installations**

- Corrected some installation jobs for z/VSE and Free Starter Edition

**5885 sources.zip**

Migration considerations
------------------------

V4.60 
^^^^^

**End of support for COMPATIBILITY mode**

The "COMPATIBILITY" mode for w2hparm, that was introduced in version 4.54 to provide seamless migration of 4.53 w2hparm to 4.54 w2hparm is no longer supported in v4.60. It is recommended to switch to "Option" mode before migrating to 4.60.

**ARBO changes**

There have been no changes to the ARBO which would require migration from V4.59 or V4.58. Customers who are migrating from older releases should review the 
“What’s new in Virtel V4.XX” newsletters to determine applicable migration actions for new distributed features. 
Depending on requirements not all actions may be applicable. These newsletters are available online at https://virtel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ 

Fixes, changes and new features
-------------------------------

Presentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

**5782 w2h page capture improved**

- Improved capture feature to support older IE browsers and multiple captures on one page

**5799 FTP and Macro Interface enhancements**

- Improved FTP interface, corrected macro panel for Edge browsers

**5800 Macro and Capture Enhancements.**

- Improved layout for macros and screen capture

**5803 FTP V1.1**

- Enhanced version of Virtel FTP feature

**5801 Insert Key support as a Joker Key**

- Allows to redefine a key as the Insert key for keyboards that do not have an Insert key
 
  - First set a Joker Key in w2hparm.js, for instance::

         w2hparm.jokerkey = 192;  // leftmost key on second row of US keyboard     

  - Then use user settings to change one of 'joker' or 'shiftjoker' or 'altjoker' to 'Ins'

  - The administrator can preset these values in w2hparm with, for instance::

         w2hparm.joker = "Ins"

    or::

         w2hparm.shiftjoker = "Ins"

.. note ::
  To determine the scancode of a key, one can use the scancode tester in the w2h directory, for instance: http://192.168.170.50:41001/w2h/scancode.htm         

**5806 Correct error with data.js to avoid old D&D template**

- Removed references to old drag and drop admin interface

  - You must press first SHIFT then CTRL for this to work consistently.

  - Ctrl + shift is by default the 'change keyboard layout' hotkey for Windows. So you possibly would have to unset this in the Windows Settings.

**5822 backspace and keypad +-**

- backspace may now be set to: 		["no", "Backtab", "Newline", "Ins"]
- shift+backspace may now be set to:	["no", "Backtab", "CLEAR", "Ins"]}

Appendix B
----------

**IPv6 implementation guidelines**

Virtel 4.60 introduces support of IPv6. 

A Virtel line can now be defined to listen on a port associated with one of the following:

- The default IP address\* of the Virtel instance: ``:41002``
- An explicit IPv4 address: ``192.168.170.80:41002``
- An explicit IPv6 address: ``[fd10:15c1:1921:1000::129]:41002``
- A DNS name: ``myvirtel.syspertec.com:41002``

\* *The default IP address is specified via the IP= parameter of the Virtel startup JCL. This can be an IPv4 or IPv6 address, or a DNS name.*

.. note ::
    **Characters [ and ] may be incorrectly displayed on the MVS console with VWA 4.60**

    The character set used natively by the MVS console is CP1047. For this reason, VIRTEL uses this codepage to write its messages to the console.
    
    So, to be able to view them from VWA, the codepage used must also be IBM1047. If this is not the default Virtel codepage (as specified in the TCT), it can be forced directly in the calling URL: http://n.n.n.n:41001/w2h/WEB2AJAX.htm+Tso?codepage=IBM1047

    The entry point must refer to a scenario allowing to process the contents of the URL variable CODEPAGE.

    By default the SCENLOGM scenario can be used.

    If another identification scenario is implemented, it must contain the following lines::

         COPY$ INPUT-TO-VARIABLE,FIELD='CODEPAGE',             * 
               VAR='CODEPAGE'                                    
         IF$ NOT-FOUND,THEN=NOCODEPG                             
         SET$  ENCODING,UTF-8,'*CODEPAGE'                       



One Virtel line can only listen on one IP address. Therefore if you want to be able to access one instance of Virtel in both IPv4 and IPv6, you will need to define separate lines for each IP address.

Here is an example of an ARBO definition that can be used to create a copy of the C-HTTP line, in IPv6 mode::

      LINE     ID=C-HTTP6,                                             -
               NAME=HTTP-CL6,                                          -
               LOCADDR=virtel_v6.syspertec.com:41002,                  -
               DESC='CLIWHOST via IPv6 address',                       -

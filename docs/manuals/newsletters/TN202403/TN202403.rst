V4.62 
^^^^^

**End of support for COMPATIBILITY mode**

The "COMPATIBILITY" mode for w2hparm, that was introduced in version 4.54 to provide seamless migration of V4.53 w2hparm to V4.54. w2hparm is no longer supported from V4.61 onwards. It is recommended to switch to "Option" mode before migrating later releases.

**6046 DCB value of STATS file changed to 255**

This has been increased to 255. Reallocate any STATS file with a LRECL=255,RECFM=VB,BLKSIZE=4096

**Version support**

Versions of Virtel older than V4.59 are no longer supported. It is recommended to migrate to the latest release.

**ARBO changes**

- There have been no changes to the ARBO which would require migration from V4.60 or V4.59. Customers who are migrating from older releases should review the “What’s new in Virtel V4.XX” newsletters to determine applicable migration actions for new distributed features. Depending on requirements not all actions may be applicable. These newsletters are available online at https://virtel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

The Virtel internace tablespace is built from the VIRCONF statements :- DEPT, USER, PROFILE and RELAY statements. A new ARBOLOAD JCL option has been added to provide a sample configuration - RELAY=YES. This feature requires the TCT USERFUNC=YES to be set.    

**6075 NFORCEIP= VIRTCT parameter**

A new TCT parameter, NFORCEIP=NO will, by default, and will ignore any changes of client IP address. This can occur when using zScaler security server. Specifying NFORCEIP=YES will enforcing that the client IP address should not change. In this instance, the connection will be disconnected.

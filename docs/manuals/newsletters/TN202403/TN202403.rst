**6051 VIRT923E ERROR REQ: PTON - RETCODE: FFFFFFFF ERRNO: 00000031 (00000049)

The x-Forwarded-For header can contain several addresses. Virtel was passing the full header value to PTON instead of only the first address, which should be the client address. The other addresses are from proxies. The X-Forwarded-For header is tested only if Virtel was called from a known proxy, as defined in HTFORWD= TCT parameter or in a rule. Only the first one in the X-Forwarded-For header is validated as a known proxy.

The VIRCONF program has been updated to correctly process the ENTRY statement during an UNLOAD request.

Message VIR0923E NO RELAY AVAILABLE issued. Corruption in the terminal block due to data overlay.

Various errors reported, such as 'NO MORE PSEUDO FOUND WITH PREFIX CLLOC'. Expiry header logic amended set correct response value. 

**6066 Possible ASRA in VIR0010**
TIOACHK check routine updated to avoid incorrect overwrite detection.

New features
------------

**6049 CRYPTS= Encrypt Virtel and Ajax session codes**

..
    CRYPTS=AES-256|AES-192|AES-128|NONE

**6068 TN3270 update**
Add TN3270 dialout to access remote Z/VM telnet servers (z/VM, external partners).

**6072 User Relay LU nailing**
A new LU nailing feature that allocates a Relay terminal/printer based on a USERID. Uses the Virtel internal tablespace API to extract the userid / terminal asspcaition. The Virtel internace tablespace is built from the VIRCONF statements :- DEPT, USER, PROFILE and RELAY statements. A new ARBOLOAD JCL option has been added to provide a sample configuration - RELAY=YES. This feature requires the TCT USERFUNC=YES to be set.    

**6075 NFORCEIP= VIRTCT parameter**
A new TCT parameter, NFORCEIP=NO will, by default, and will ignore any changes of client IP address. This can occur when using zScaler security server. Specifying NFORCEIP=YES will enforcing that the client IP address should not change. In this instance, the connection will be disconnected.

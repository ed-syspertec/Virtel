VIRTEL SMF Support
==================

Virtel VIRSTATS can now be written to SMF. The VIRTERM macro has been
changed to support an additional SMF parameter. See below.

Updated STATS= keyword.

STATS = NO \| YES \| SMF \| (SMF,*nnn*) \| (MULTI, TERMINATE \|
CONTINUE)

The default SMF record number is 223. The user specified number *nnn*
must be between 128 and 255.

**Logic changes**

VIR0000 Modified to load VIR0006A into PPI.

VIR0006 Modified to call VIR0006A to write SMF record.

    Must now be authorized - AC=1.

VIR0006A New module which writes SMF records using SMFWTM macro.

VIRTERM Macro updated to support new parameters.

**Messages**

VIRTERM macro.

‘LE PARAMETRE “STATS(SMF,nnn)” EST INVALIDE.’

VIR0612E VIRSTAT SMFWTM FAILED. RC=rc.

VIR0611I VIRSTAT NOW RECORDING TO SMF.

**User Actions**

VIRTCTxx will have to be reassembled to implement SMF.

**SMF record format.**

The same as the current STATS record but prefixed by the standard SMF
header. See Chapter 2 in the Virtel Messages and Operations manual for a
layout of the STATS records.

**SMF Printing**

There is a REXX job in SPTHOLT.MVS.JCL(SMFPRINT) which will print the
SMF records from the SYS1.MANx dataset. This could be added to the
SAMPLIB dataset.

**Notes:**

Could add some additional statistics to the SMF record. For example
memory usage.

Doesn’t work with VIR60000. Authorization disabled. Need to speak to
Serge.

Action
Check that the browser requested the correct URL. Check the definition of the entry point epname. If reason is “missing directory : dirname”, ensure that there is a type 4 transaction with external name dirname. If reason is “rejected transaction : tranid”, ensure that there is a type 1 transaction with external name tranid. See “VIRTEL URL formats” in the VIRTEL Web Access Guide.</p>

VIRHTTP
Meaning
An HTTP request was received from proxy-ip on the HTTP line whose internal name is n-xxxxxx. The source IP address proxy-ip appears in the “Calling DTE” field of a rule attached to the HTTP line, and the request matches the rule in all other respects. VIRTEL considers the IP address real-ip, which is specified in the “forwarding header” inserted by the proxy, to be the real originating IP address. Refer to “Calling DTE” in the “Rules” chapter of the VIRTEL Configuration Reference manual for further information.</p>
<p>Action
VIRTEL henceforth treats the call as if it had been received from real-ip instead of from proxy-ip. The real-ip address will be displayed in console messages and recorded in the VIRLOG.</p>
<p>VIRHT57E linename RECEIVED AN ERRONEOUS REQUEST FROM ipaddr:port : LINE IS NOT SET UP FOR HTTPS</p>
<p>Module
VIRHTTP
Meaning
VIRTEL received a request on the HTTP line whose external name is linename originating from the browser at IP address ipaddr:port. The browser has requested that the session should be encrypted using the SSL or TLS protocols, but encryption is not activated for this line.
Action

<p>Module
VIR0I09
Meaning
The relay LU luname associated with VIRTEL terminal termid received an unsolicited SNA BIND command from application applname. VIRTEL rejected the BIND because the LU was not expecting to receive a session request from applname. This can occur if a PCNE application is attempting to place an outgoing call to an LU reserved for incoming calls.
Action

<p>Module
VIR0T09
Meaning
VIRTEL has opened TCP/IP socket socknum on the line with external name linename. If socknum is 00000000 then this is a listening socket, port is the listening port number, and ipaddr is the IP address on which VIRTEL accepts incoming connections (000.000.000.000 means that VIRTEL accepts connections on any of the host’s home IP addresses). If socknum is non-zero and port is non-zero, then this is an incoming connection, and ipaddr:port is the client’s IP address and port number. If socknum is non-zero and port is 00000, then this is an outgoing connection, and ipaddr is VIRTEL’s  IP address (000.000.000.000 means that VIRTEL is using the host’s default home address).

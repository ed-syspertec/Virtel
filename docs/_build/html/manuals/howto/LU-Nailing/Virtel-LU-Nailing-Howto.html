<p><strong>1.1 Description</strong></p>
<p>This document describes procedures for assigning fixed LU names to
specific users in VIRTEL Web Access. This is known as <em>LU nailing.</em></p>
<p>Before you attempt the procedures described in this document, you should
first install VIRTEL and get basic access to your 3270 application
working using the sample definitions provided with the product. Do not
attempt to define LU nailing with cookies until you have got the basic
VIRTEL Web Access functions working and demonstrated to your
satisfaction.</p>
<p><strong>1.2 What is VIRTEL Web Access?</strong></p>
<p>VIRTEL Web Access is a software product which enables users to access
mainframe 3270 applications from a standard web browser, without
intermediate servers, without Java, and without installing any
additional software on the workstation.</p>
<p><strong>1.3 What is LU nailing?</strong></p>
<p>When a user connects to a 3270 application through VIRTEL Web Access,
VIRTEL makes it appear to the application as if the user is connecting
from a virtual 3270 terminal. In VTAM terms a virtual 3270 terminal is
called a <em>Logical Unit</em> or <em>LU</em>, and each LU has a unique eight
character name (<em>LU name)</em>. VIRTEL has at its disposal a pool of LUs
known to VTAM, whose names are specified in the VIRTEL configuration
file (the VIRARBO file). Normally when a user connects to a 3270
application, VIRTEL chooses any available LU from the pool.</p>
<p>While most mainframe applications will accept a connection from any LU
name, certain applications (particularly applications which run under
IMS) are sensitive to the LU name because they assign permissions to the
user based upon the LU name of the user’s terminal. LU nailing allows
VIRTEL to assign a particular LU name to a user based upon the user’s IP
address or upon a cookie presented by the user’s browser.</p>
<p><strong>1.4 What are the different types of LU nailing?</strong></p>
<p>This document describes the following types of LU nailing:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>LU nailing by IP address</p></li>
<li><p>LU nailing by cookie delivered by e-mail</p></li>
<li><p>LU nailing by cookie obtained by self-registration</p></li>
<li><p>LU nailing by URL</p></li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="how-to-activate-lu-nailing-by-ip-address">
<h2>2 How to activate LU nailing by IP address<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-activate-lu-nailing-by-ip-address" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>2.1 Description</strong></p>
<p>This chapter describes the procedure for setting up a VIRTEL
configuration which will map specific IP addresses to predefined LU
names. This kind of mapping is suitable where users connect from fixed
IP addresses. The mapping is done by VIRTEL “rules”, and does not
require cookies.</p>
<p>The procedure is described by way of two examples. The first example
shows how to map individual IP addresses to specified LU names. The
second example shows how to map a range of IP addresses to a pool of LU
names.</p>
<p><strong>2.2 Mapping individual IP addresses to LU names</strong></p>
<p>In this example we will choose three IP addresses and map each one to a
specific LU name, as shown in the table below:</p>
<table class="docutils align-default">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 55%" />
<col style="width: 45%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head"><p><strong>IP address</strong></p></th>
<th class="head"><p><strong>LU name</strong></p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>192.168.0.39</p></td>
<td><p>RHTVT001</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>192.168.0.147</p></td>
<td><p>RHTVT002</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>192.168.0.45</p></td>
<td><p>RHTVT003</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>To configure this mapping we will add three rules to the W-HTTP line.
This is the line defined as port 41001 in the VIRTEL sample
configuration.</p>
<p>First logon to VIRTEL via (tn)3270 and press F1=Admin, or select “Admin”
from the VIRTEL Web Access menu. Then select F1=Lines. Put the cursor on
W-HTTP and press F12 to see the LINE DETAIL DEFINITION panel, then F5 to
see the rules associated with the line:</p>
<p><img alt="image21" src="../../../_images/image21.png" /></p>
<p><em>Figure ‎2.1 List of rules for W-HTTP line</em></p>
<p>Place the cursor on WHT00200 and press F12 to add a new rule. We will
add one new rule for each IP-LU mapping. Here is what you need to enter
to create the first rule:</p>
<p><img alt="image22" src="../../../_images/image22.png" /></p>
<p><em>Figure ‎2.2 Rule to map IP address 192.168.0.39 to LU RHTVT001</em></p>
<p>You must choose a unique name for the rule. Here we have chosen
WHT00110, to fit in with the names delivered in the sample
configuration. Rules are processed in alphanumeric order of name, so it
is important that the name you choose should precede the name of the
default rule, which is delivered as WHT00200. For a production
configuration you could choose any naming scheme.</p>
<p>In the “IP Subnet” field, place a “1” in the column on the left (this
activates the testing of the IP address for this rule), and then type
the IP address “192.168.000.039” into the field as shown. The “Mask”
field must contain “255.255.255.255” which means that the entire IP
address is tested.</p>
<p>For documentation purposes, you should also include the IP address in
the “Description” field.</p>
<p>In the “Parameter” field, type the name of the LU to be nailed to this
IP address.</p>
<p>Note: the LU name must be defined in a VIRTEL pool, see “Adding LUs to
the pool” on page 11.</p>
<p>The “Entry Point” field should contain WEB2HOST, which is the normal
entry point associated with the W-HTTP line on port 41001.</p>
<p>Now press ENTER to add the rule, then F4 to activate it.</p>
<p>Next repeat the process to add the second rule:</p>
<p><img alt="image23" src="../../../_images/image23.png" /></p>
<p><em>Figure ‎2.3 Rule to map IP address 192.168.0.147 to LU RHTVT002</em></p>
<p>Press ENTER to add the rule and F4 to activate it.</p>
<p>Then the same for the third rule:</p>
<p><img alt="image24" src="../../../_images/image24.png" /></p>
<p><em>Figure ‎2.4 Rule to map IP address 192.168.0.45 to LU RHTVT003</em></p>
<p>Again press ENTER to add the rule and F4 to activate it.</p>
<p>Finally press F3 to go back to the list of rules for the W-HTTP line,
which should now look like this:</p>
<p><img alt="image25" src="../../../_images/image25.png" /></p>
<p><em>Figure ‎2.5 Updated list of rules for W-HTTP line</em></p>
<p>Now, for example, when you connect to a host application via VIRTEL port
41001 from a browser at address 192.168.0.147, you will get LU name
RHTVT002.</p>
<p><strong>2.3 Mapping a range of IP addresses to a pool of LU names</strong></p>
<p>The second example shows how to map a range of IP addresses to a pool of
LU names. We will add an additional rule which will ensure that all
connections in the network 192.168.100.0 through 192.168.100.255 will be
assigned the next unused LU name in the range RHTVT1xx, as shown in the
table below:</p>
<table class="docutils align-default">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 56%" />
<col style="width: 44%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head"><p><strong>IP address</strong></p></th>
<th class="head"><p><strong>LU name</strong></p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>192.168.100.nnn</p></td>
<td><p>RHTVT1xx</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>To set up this mapping we will add another rule, using the same
procedure as described in the previous section. The rule is shown below:</p>
<p><img alt="image26" src="../../../_images/image26.png" /></p>
<p><em>Figure ‎2.6 Rule to map IP address 192.168.100.nnn to LU pool RHTVT1xx</em></p>
<p>The new rule is named WHT00140, the “IP Subnet” field specifies the IP
address 192.168.100.000, and the “Mask” is set to 255.255.255.000 to
indicate that only the first three octets of the IP address are tested
to determine whether the rule matches the IP address of the client
browser. The “parameter” field specifies a generic LU name RHTVT1*
which signifies that any LU whose name begins with RHTVT1 may be
assigned to clients whose IP address matches this rule.</p>
<p>Note: the LU names must be defined in a VIRTEL pool, see “Adding LUs to
the pool” on page 11.</p>
<p>Press ENTER to add the rule, then F4 to activate it.</p>
<p><strong>2.4 The default rule</strong></p>
<p>You will notice that there is a default “catch-all” rule WHT00200 (other
users) which will be taken for any IP address which is not matched by
one of the earlier rules. If you do not want unmatched IP addresses to
be able to access the system, change this rule so that it specifies a
non-existent LU name in the “parameter” field. This will cause VIRTEL to
issue an error message and close the connection. Optionally, you could
change this rule so that it goes to an entry point which displays a
panel with an appropriate message such as “Access not authorized”.</p>

<h2>3 How to activate LU nailing with cookies delivered by e-mail<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-activate-lu-nailing-with-cookies-delivered-by-e-mail" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>3.1 Description</strong></p>
<p>This chapter describes the procedure for setting up LU nailing with
cookies delivered by e-mail. The procedure consists of defining a user,
associating an LU name with the user, and sending the user an e-mail
containing a browser cookie. When the user’s browser subsequently
connects to a mainframe application such as IMS or CICS via VIRTEL Web
Access, VIRTEL recognizes the security code contained in the cookie and
assigns the designated LU name to the user during communication with the
application.</p>
<p><strong>3.2 Setting up the SMTP line</strong></p>
<p>In VIRTEL terms, a user identified by cookie is known as a
“correspondent”. The cookie is initially delivered to the correspondent
by e-mail, so before you can activate a correspondent, you have to make
sure that you have your VIRTEL SMTP line correctly configured. See
section “1.2.4 Examples of line definitions” subsection “Definition of
an SMTP line” on page 24 of the <em>VIRTEL Connectivity Reference</em> manual.</p>
<p>You can add an SMTP line to the VIRTEL configuration by running the
ARBOLOAD job in the VIRTEL CNTL library. If you did not already do so at
VIRTEL installation time, specify SMTP=YES in the options at the start
of the job, and rerun ARBOLOAD which will add an SMTP line named S-SMTP
to the VIRTEL configuration file. Now stop and restart the VIRTEL STC.</p>
<p>Next, logon to VIRTEL via (tn)3270 and choose F1=Admin then F1=Lines.
Put the cursor on line S-SMTP and press F12. In “remote ident” you need
to put the IP address and port number of your SMTP server (this will
normally be the same SMTP server as you have configured in your desktop
e-mail client). Leave “local ident” unchanged, we do not use it since
VIRTEL will not be receiving any incoming e-mails for this application.
Fill in the “description” field as defined in the <em>VIRTEL Connectivity
Reference</em> manual.</p>
<p>Press F1 to save the updated line definition. Then stop and start the</p>
<p>SMTP line using these MVS commands:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">F</span> <span class="n">VIRTEL</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">LINE</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">S</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">SMTP</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">P</span>

<span class="n">F</span> <span class="n">VIRTEL</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">LINE</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">S</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">SMTP</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">S</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><strong>3.3 Setting up the rules for LU nailing with cookies</strong></p>
<p>A set of “rules” attached to the VIRTEL HTTP line determines how VIRTEL
processes incoming requests. To see the rules attached to an HTTP line,
go to the VIRTEL Configuration Menu and press F1=Lines, then put the
cursor on the name of the line and press F5=Rules. The list of rules
attached to the W-HTTP line (port 41001) is shown below:</p>
<p><img alt="image31" src="../../../_images/image31.png" /></p>
<p><em>Figure ‎3.1 Rules for line W-HTTP</em></p>
<p>Normally all requests are processed by a default “catch-all” rule. For
the W-HTTP line the default rule is named WHT00200. This default rule
assigns an entry point (in this case WEB2HOST) and selects the next
available LU from the terminal pool *W2HPOOL. When LU nailing with
cookies is in effect, a different rule WHT00100 is selected for users
who present a cookie containing a valid security code. This rule also
assigns entry point WEB2HOST, but the LU name is obtained from the
user’s correspondent record.</p>
<p>The rule for LU nailing is shown below:</p>
<p><img alt="image32" src="../../../_images/image32.png" /></p>
<p><em>Figure ‎3.2 Rule for LU nailing by cookie</em></p>
<p>The rule for LU nailing has the special value $COOKIE$ in the
“Parameter” field. This value has a two-fold meaning: firstly, it
ensures that the rule is matched only for users who present a cookie
containing a valid security code, and secondly, it indicates to VIRTEL
that the LU name is taken from “VTAM name” field in the user’s
correspondent record.</p>
<p>Users who do not present a cookie, or whose cookie contains an invalid
or expired security code, will not match this rule and will drop through
to the next rule, which in this example is the “catch-all” rule
WHT00200.</p>
<p><strong>3.4 Defining a user</strong></p>
<p>Now you can define your first user. From the VIRTEL Configuration Menu,
press F5=Correspondents. At the “List of correspondents” panel, press
F12 then fill in these fields:</p>
<p><img alt="image33" src="../../../_images/image33.png" /></p>
<p><em>Figure ‎3.3 Correspondent detail screen - e-mail correspondent</em></p>
<p>Replace <em>john.user&#64;whatever.com</em> by the user’s e-mail address.</p>
<p>Replace <em>192.168.5.30</em> by the host IP address where VIRTEL is running</p>
<p>Replace RHTVT003 by the LU name to be assigned to this user</p>
<p>Note: the LU name must be defined in a VIRTEL pool, see “Adding LUs to
the pool” on page 11.</p>
<p>Leave the “Rule Set” and “Directory” fields blank</p>
<p>Now press Enter. You should get the message “CREATION OK”</p>
<p>See section “1.1.6 Correspondent management” in the *VIRTEL Web Access
Guide* for a detailed description of how to define a correspondent.</p>
<p><strong>3.5 Delivering the cookie via e-mail</strong></p>
<p>Next we will send the cookie to the user.</p>
<p>In the “CORRESPONDENT DETAIL DEFINITION” panel, press F4=Activate. The
message “ACTIVATION WAS REQUESTED” indicates that VIRTEL has sent the
cookie to the user via the SMTP server.</p>
<p>If this is the first time you have tried sending an e-mail from VIRTEL,
then it is quite possible that it will fail if the configuration is not
yet correct. If the e-mail does not arrive at the user’s workstation,
then enter the following MVS command:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">F</span> <span class="n">VIRTEL</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">TRACE</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">L</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">S</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">SMTP</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>then press F4=Activate again to generate a trace of VIRTEL’s dialog with
the SMTP server. The dialog is traced in the SYSPRINT dataset of the
VIRTEL started task (use SDSF to see it). From this you should be able
to see what the problem is. Common problems are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>codepage problem (the e-mail address in the MAIL TO command should contain an &#64; sign. If it does not, then check that the COUNTRY parameter in the VIRTCT matches your host codepage)</p></li>
<li><p>the SMTP server does not accept VIRTEL’s HELO or MAIL FROM command, check that the userid and hostname specified in the “description” field of the S-SMTP line are values which are acceptable to your mailserver. You may need to liaise with the company’s e-mail administrator to agree on appropriate values.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3.6 Installing the cookie on the browser</strong></p>
<p>When the e-mail arrives at the user’s workstation, it will contain a
hyperlink to a VIRTEL page. The user clicks on this hyperlink to install
the cookie in his browser.</p>
<p>One point to note here: the desktop administrator may have set the
security settings to inhibit the browser from storing cookies on the
user’s workstation. Often the simplest solution to this problem is make
sure that the browser recognizes VIRTEL’s IP address as being in the
“Local Intranet” zone, and not the “Internet” zone. You can verify the
zone by looking at the icon in the bottom right hand corner of the
Internet Explorer screen when the VIRTEL web page is displayed. If it
says “Internet” then you need to click “Tools - Internet Options -
Security - Local Intranet - Sites – Advanced” and add VIRTEL’s IP
address to the list.</p>
<p><strong>3.7 Using the cookie</strong></p>
<p>Having installed the cookie on the workstation, now whenever this user
calls up a VIRTEL web page, VIRTEL will recognize that the cookie
matches the one previously sent to john.user, and so it will assign the
LU name RHTVT003 when connecting to a host application.</p>

<h2>4 How to activate VIRTEL LU nailing with cookies obtained by self-registration<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-activate-virtel-lu-nailing-with-cookies-obtained-by-self-registration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This chapter describes the procedure for setting up LU nailing with
cookies, where the users initially obtain the cookie by a procedure
known as “self-registration”. This is similar to LU nailing described in
the previous section, except that the cookie is delivered to the user by
a web-page instead of by e-mail. The first time a user accesses VIRTEL,
the user is directed to a special self-registration page which assigns
an LU name, creates a record in the correspondent file, and delivers a
cookie to the user’s browser. When the user subsequently connects to a
mainframe application such as IMS or CICS via VIRTEL Web Access, VIRTEL
recognizes the security code contained in the cookie and assigns the
designated LU name to the user for communication with the application.</p>
<p><strong>4.1 Setting up the rules for self-registration</strong></p>
<p>This section will be completed in a subsequent edition of the
documentation.</p>

<p><strong>5.1 Displaying the terminal pool</strong></p>
<p>All LUs which participate in LU nailing must be defined to VIRTEL in a
terminal pool. To view the terminal pools, logon to VIRTEL via (tn)3270
and press F1=Admin, or select “Admin” from the VIRTEL Web Access menu.
Then select F2=Terminals. You will see a panel similar to the one shown
in the figure below:</p>
<p><img alt="image51" src="../../../_images/image51.png" /></p>
<p><em>Figure ‎5.1 List of terminals</em></p>
<p>In the above display we can see that there are 80 terminals in the pool
named *W2HPOOL, and their internal names are W2HTP000 to W2HTP079. The
corresponding LU names are RHTVT000 to RHTVT079, and these are the LU
names available for LU nailing when the system is initially installed.</p>
<p>In the following sections we shall see how to add LU names to the pool.</p>
<p><strong>5.2 Adding a terminal to the pool</strong></p>
<p>In this section we will add a new LU named NYCTERM to the terminal pool
used for Web Access. Position the cursor on W2HTP000 and press F12 to
display the TERMINAL DEFINITION DETAIL screen, and fill in the fields as
shown below:</p>
<p><img alt="image52" src="../../../_images/image52.png" /></p>
<p><em>Figure ‎5.2 Adding a terminal to the pool</em></p>
<p>The <em>terminal name</em> is an internal name used only within VIRTEL. Any
name may be chosen so long as it does not duplicate any other terminal
name or any LU name.</p>
<p>The <em>relay name</em> is the LU name. This LU must also be defined in the
VIRTAPPL node in USER.VTAMLST.</p>
<p>The <em>pool name</em> must be specified as *W2HPOOL to associate the terminal
with Web Access.</p>
<p>Set the <em>repeat count</em> to 1 as we are defining only one terminal.</p>
<p>Now press Enter to add the terminal definition, and press F3 to return
to the list of terminals.</p>
<p><strong>5.3 Adding a range of terminals to the pool</strong></p>
<p>In this section we will add a range of LU names SJC001 to SJC010 to the
terminal pool for Web Access. Press F12 in the LIST of TERMINALS screen
and fill in the fields as shown below:</p>
<p><img alt="image53" src="../../../_images/image53.png" /></p>
<p><em>Figure ‎5.3 Adding a range of terminals to the pool</em></p>
<p>The <em>terminal name</em> is the internal name of the first terminal in the
range. The name should contain sufficient trailing numeric characters to
accommodate the number of terminals in the range, without duplicating
any other terminal name or LU name.</p>
<p>The <em>relay name</em> is the LU name of the first terminal in the range. This
name must also contain sufficient trailing numeric characters. All the
LUs in the range must be defined in the VIRTAPPL node in USER.VTAMLST.</p>
<p>The <em>pool name</em> must be specified as *W2HPOOL.</p>
<p>Set the <em>repeat count</em> to 10 to define ten terminals SJC001 to SJC010.</p>
<p><strong>5.4 Displaying the updated terminal pool</strong></p>
<p>Press Enter to add the terminal definition, then press F3 to return to
the list of terminals, which should now look like this:</p>

<p><strong>6.1 Description</strong></p>
<p>In this section we explain how to set up self-registration.
Self-registration is a process whereby a user can connect to Virtel and
self-register their details. Upon self-registration Virtel will deliver
a clickable link which will deliver the security code to the user’s
browser via a cookie. Users or “correspondents” as they are called, who
use this process are defined as local or changing users. A local
correspondent will have a fixed security code, whereas a changing
correspondent will have a new security code each time they connect.</p>
<p><strong>6.2 Setup</strong></p>
<p>For Virtel Self Registration to work a certain amount of customization
is required. In the example that follows we will demonstrate setting up
a self-registration process by using the VIRCONF ARBO configuration
tool.</p>
<p>In our example, a new line will be created to support
“self-registration” users. A new directory will be created to support
the web elements. The relevant ARBO configuration statements and WEB
artifacts will be installed in their respective repositories.</p>
<p>The following diagram gives an overview of the Virtel schematic to
support self-registration.</p>

<p>Three different types of terminal statements are required. First, a
terminal relay pool is defined by the XLPOOL0 statement. It represents
16 relay terminals in a pool. Any user terminal statement supporting an
external user, i.e. a PC, must refer to this pool. The XLLOC000
statement defines a local terminal range of 16 terminals. These not
relay related definitions and as such do not refer to the pool. They are
used to support Virtel internal work tasks. The XLPC0000 statement
represents a user’s dedicated PC connection and refers to the XLPOOL0
pool where it will obtain a relay LU when this user connects. For each
PC there must be a separate terminal statement which defines the LU name
to be used. In this case the LU name that would be used is HOLTWIN7.</p>
<p>The administration sub application “Correspondent” is the tool that
manages the physical PC representation to a logical LU name. In
following screen shot we can see how self-registration of a user
collocates with a predefined LU name.</p>
<p><img alt="image62" src="../../../_images/image62.png" /></p>
<p><em>Figure ‎6.2 Correspondent Detail Definition</em></p>
<p>As you can see, the ID is the physical PC name submitted by the user
during the Self-Registration process and the VTAM name is the LU name
that will be associated with this PC. The “Correspondent”
sub-application is where users and LU names defined. For
“self-registration” the id type is “2”. An entry will be made into the
“Correspondent” HTML VSAM file every time a user goes through the
self-registration process. Self-registration users are controlled
through rules attached to the line. The rules attached to the X-HTTP
line are as follows.</p>
<p><em>6.2.3 The Rule definitions</em></p>

</div>
<p>For line X-HHTP, serving port 41003, only IP address beginning
192.168.*.* will be allowed to self-register. Any other IP address
using this port will be passed to an ENTRY POINT called EPREJECT where a
reject message will be served and displayed on the users screen.</p>
<p>The first time a user calls in on 41003 there will be no cookie passed.
Rule R0000200 will pick up this call and call entry point INITVTAM. This
will initiate the self-registration process. For users already
self-registered the call in will conatin a cookie in the HTTP request.
This will be trapped by rule R0000100 and passed to entry point
EXCWHOST.</p>

<p>The default transaction, EXCW-00, will serve page EXCWHOST.htm from the
EXC-DIR directory. EXCW-01 is a routing transaction that provides a link
to the web elements in W2H-DIR and EXCW-41 and EXCW-42 are VTAM
application definitions that are available to self-registration users.
These transaction are accessed via hard coded links in the EXCWHOST.HTM
page but equally could be part of an APPLIST menu display.</p>
<p><em>6.2.6 The Sub Directory and related web pages</em></p>

<p><strong>6.3 The Correspondent Sub Application</strong></p>
<p>Access to the Correspondent Sub Application is as follows. From the
VIRTEL Configuration Menu, press F5=Correspondents.</p>
<p><img alt="image63" src="../../../_images/image63.png" /></p>
<p><em>Figure ‎6.3 Selecting the Correspondent Sub Application</em></p>
<p>A list of self-registered correspondents will appear. In our list there
is one user who is recognized by the ID of HOLT-WIN7. This just so
happens to be the PC Name belonging to user. Through the sub-application
we can associate this user with a relay LUNAME HOLTWIN7.</p>
<p><img alt="image64" src="../../../_images/image64.png" /></p>
<p><em>Figure ‎6.4 Listing of Correspondent</em></p>
<p><em>6.3.1 The Self-Registration Process</em></p>
<p>The first phase of the self-registration process is that a user will
access the designated port without a security cookie and be routed to
the VTAMINIT Entry Point. This will drive the registration process by
serving the INITVTAM.HTM page to the user. The user will be presented
with the following screen:-</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../../_images/image65.png"><img alt="image65" src="../../../_images/image65.png" style="width: 5.88542in; height: 3.90625in;" /></a></p>
<p><em>Figure ‎6.5. Self-Registration page from VTAMINIT Page 1</em></p>
<p>Two options are provide on this page. Option one is to complete the
self-registration proceed to the application menu page or option2 is to
complete the self-registration process and wait to be given the URL to
connect to the system. This URL can then be used to connect multiple
browsers.</p>
<p>Selecting either option invokes the Virtel transaction INITV-10 (NAIL)
which uses Security=2. This level of security uses the NTLM handshake
protocol to extract additional workstation information. This information
is presented in the second page of the self-registration process and can
be changed by the user.</p>
<p>Once any option has been selected then the second page of the
registration will be present. In this page you provide the LUNAME that
you have been allocated (external process) and you collocated
correspondent name, by default the work station name.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../../_images/image66.png"><img alt="image66" src="../../../_images/image66.png" style="width: 6.50000in; height: 5.84375in;" /></a></p>
<p><em>Figure ‎6.6. Self-Registration page from VTAMINIT Page 2</em></p>
<p>By confirming the details of the VTAM luname and correspondent (ID) the
browser will send the information back to Virtel. Virtel will then
record the information in the Correspondent data base and then launch
the EXCWHOST transaction which will display a menu page of applications
than the user can access.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../../_images/image67.png"><img alt="image67" src="../../../_images/image67.png" style="width: 6.28125in; height: 1.84375in;" /></a></p>
<p><em>Figure ‎6.7. Self-Registration application menu page</em></p>
<p>In the example for HOLT-WIN7 the entry in the database would look like
the following:-</p>
<p><img alt="image68" src="../../../_images/image68.png" /></p>
<p><em>Figure ‎6.8 Correspondent Entry</em></p>
<p>It is clear that the LUNAME of HOLT-WIN is invalid so this must be
corrected in the Edit panel. Pressing PF12 will take us into the Edit
panel of the correspondent application where the LUNAME can be amended
to the correct name allocated for HOLT-WIN. In this example the name is
changed to HOLTWIN7.</p>
<p><img alt="image69" src="../../../_images/image69.png" /></p>
<p><em>Figure ‎6.9 Updating the Correspondent Entry with the correct LUNAME</em></p>
<p>Once the LUNAME has been updated the user identified as HOLT-WIN7/ can
access applications via the EXCWHOST application list. A VTAM definition
must exist to support this user. The VTAM definition will look like
this:-</p>
<p>HOLTWIN7 APPL AUTH=(ACQ,PASS),MODETAB=ISTINCLM,DLOGMOD=SNX32702,EAS=1</p>
<p>To support this VTAM LUNAME a Virtel Terminal definition must also exit
in the ARBO configuration. The definitional must use a predefined pool.
For HOLT-WIN7/ see the terminal definition XLPC0000.</p>
<p><img alt="image610" src="../../../_images/image610.png" /></p>
<p><em>Figure ‎6.10 Terminal list with the correct Relay(LUNAME) name</em></p>
<p><em>6.3.2 The Correspondent Application Options</em></p>
<p>From within the Correspondent Application self-registered users can be
managed. The following option are available:-</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">PF</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">1</span>    <span class="n">Update</span> <span class="n">an</span> <span class="n">Entry</span>
<span class="n">Enter</span>   <span class="n">Add</span> <span class="n">an</span> <span class="n">Entry</span>
<span class="n">PF</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">4</span>    <span class="n">Activate</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">disabled</span> <span class="n">entry</span>
<span class="n">PF</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">5</span>    <span class="n">Deactivate</span> <span class="n">an</span> <span class="n">Active</span> <span class="n">Entry</span>
<span class="n">PF</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">6</span>    <span class="n">Add</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">rule</span> <span class="n">using</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">IP</span> <span class="n">details</span><span class="o">.</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Using these functions provides a means of administering correspondents.
The following is an example of disabling a user:-</p>
<p><img alt="image611" src="../../../_images/image611.png" /></p>
<p><em>Figure ‎6.11 Disabling a Correspondent using PF5</em></p>
<p>If the user attempts to access the system Virtel will not permit access
as the cookie will no longer be valid and the ID will block any further
attempts to re-register.</p>
<p><em>6.3.3 Customization</em></p>
<p>The sample web elements can be customized. For example, by default, the
Correspondent name field is an HTML input field. This allows the user to
specify any id. For additional security it is recommended that this
field be changed to a displayable field only thereby preventing the user
from self-registering against a known LU name. The sample templates
CONFIRMANDGO.HTM and CONFIRMANDWAIT.HTM should be amended and the
&lt;INPUT&gt; tag removed for this field.</p>
<p>An Virtel APPLIST transaction may be used instead of the static EXCWHOST
page.</p>
<p>Virtel scenarios may be used to check and validate the incoming call and
introduce different behavior depending on the IP address and variables
contained with the cookie.</p>

What’s new in Virtel 4.61 GA Release
=====================================================

The following newsletter summaries the new features and maintenance updates that can be found in Virtel Release 4.61. 

Installation changes
--------------------

**5900 VIRTERM/Samplib changes**

- SAMPLIB TCT members: Changed BUFSIZE from 20000 to 32000

**5921 Correct Version number**

- Update installation files with correct version number.

Migration considerations
------------------------

V4.61 
^^^^^

**End of support for COMPATIBILITY mode**

The "COMPATIBILITY" mode for w2hparm, that was introduced in version 4.54 to provide seamless migration of V4.53 w2hparm to V4.54. w2hparm is no longer supported in V4.61. It is recommended to switch to "Option" mode before migrating to V4.61.

**Version support**

Versions of Virtel older than V4.58 are no longer supported.

**ARBO changes**

There have been no changes to the ARBO which would require migration from V4.60, V4.59 or V4.58. Customers who are migrating from older releases should review the 
“What’s new in Virtel V4.XX” newsletters to determine applicable migration actions for new distributed features. 
Depending on requirements not all actions may be applicable. These newsletters are available online at https://virtel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

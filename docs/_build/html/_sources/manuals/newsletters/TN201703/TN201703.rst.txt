Passticket support with CA Top Secret
=====================================

Supporting pass tickets with CA Top Secret requires the following
definitions.

1. Add the PTKTDATA class to the RDT

TSS ADDTO(RDT) RESCLASS(PTKTDATA) RESCODE(n) ACLST(ALL,READ,UPDATE)
MAXLEN(37)

Note: RESCODE should be in the range 101 to 13F to ensure that PTKTDATA
is a prefixed resource class.

2. Add the ownership of the PassTicket resource (IRRPTAUTH)

TSS ADDTO(owner) PTKTDATA(IRRPTAUTH)

Note: The resource can be one of the following where resource name is the Application Name defined in the NDT and ‘userid’ is the Userid:

PTKTDATA(IRRPTAUTH.name.)

or

PTKTDATA(IRRPTAUTH.name.userid)

Note: The name must equal the name in the Passticket field of the Virtel transaction. This can be different to the ACB or Virtel Application name.

3. Define the application session key

TSS ADDTO(NDT) PSTKAPPL(name) SESSKEY(0123456789ABCDEF) SIGNMULTI

4. Permit access to the PassTicket resource

TSS PERMIT(stc‐userid) PTKTDATA(IRRPTAUTH.name) ACCESS(UPDATE)

Note: The stc-userid is the ACID of any started task that requires access to the PassTicket resource such as CA LDAP.

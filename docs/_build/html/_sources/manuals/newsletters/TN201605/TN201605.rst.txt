CICS Printing
=============

In this newsletter we discuss printing from a CICS application to a
Virtel 3270 printer. The CICS API support for printing is the same as
that for writing to a display terminal with some additional print format
considerations. Terminal control commands (SEND) and BMS commands (SEND
MAP, SEND TEXT, etc.) are both supported. In our sample CICS application
we use SEND TEXT commands to build up a 3270 buffer image. When the
buffer image is complete we issue a SEND PAGE which causes CICS to send
the buffer to the Virtel 3270 printer. To CICS the Virtel printer looks
like any supported IBM 3270 printer, an IBM 3287 for example. Depending
on the Virtel printer configuration will dictate how Virtel processes
the 3270 print buffer. For 3270 data streams Virtel will convert the
buffer image into a HTML template and forward this on to the browser to
be displayed in a separate browser window. For SCS data streams Virtel
doesn’t convert the data but instead stores it on disk in its raw format
for further processing.

**CICS supported printers and print orders.**

CICS supports two different types of printers, printers that support
3270 data streams which contain buffer control and print format orders
(SBA, SF orders, etc.) and non-3270 printers that support only the SNA
character set (SCS). A 3270 data stream printer is normally referred to
as a LU type 0 or LU type 3, whereas a SCS printer is known as a LU type
1. Printers can be configured within CICS to support different
characteristics – line count, line width, page size etc. Most of these
settings are associated with the printer’s Terminal and Typterm CICS
table entries.

Two issues associated with CICS printing are:-

1. The formatting considerations.

2. Associating a task to the printer.

In our examples there are no formatting considerations other than
pagination and newline processing. This is taken care of by the CICS
NLEOM route option and by inserting a FormFeed within the CICS printer
buffer area during the buffer build process.

We associate a task to the destination printer by using the CICS ROUTE
command and build a route list storage area identifying our target
printer within the CICS application.

**Virtel printer support**

Virtel provides support for both SCS (LU Type 1) and 3270 data stream
(LU Type 0/3) printers. Virtel can also be configured to pre-allocate or
dynamically allocate the printer LU. Dynamically allocating the printer
LU means that the printer can be shared amongst 3270 applications, only
using the printer as and when required by the application. Depending on
the support printer depicts different Virtel behavior when the browser
receives the print data. Virtel provides support for PCL data print
controls streams embedded within SCS using the SCS x’35’ command order.
Virtel performs no conversion on SCS data streams but instead just saves
the raw data to disk as a PCL file. PCL to PDF conversion using external
services such as a third party server or conversion product are
available through Virtel’s scenario API.

In the following printer examples we look at various configuration and
supported features.

**Example 1 – 3270 data stream printing**

Virtel Configuration.

In this example we have configured the Virtel display terminal REHVT000
and its associate relay printer terminal REHIP000 with the following
characteristics.

|image0|

*Fig. 1 - Terminal Display*

Display REHVT000 has an associate relay of REHIP000 which is defined as
a Type = P. Type = P indicates that this is a dynamically allocated
printer LU, supporting 3270 data streams. Both the display and printer
LUs belong to the \*W2HPOOL of terminals. The non-dynamic alternative is
to specify TYPE=2 which means Virtel will allocate the printer terminal
LU at start up.

CICS configuration.

In CICS we have defined the following terminal definitions. EHT0
representing the display LU REHVT000 and EHS0 representing the printer
LU REHIP000.

|image1|

*Fig. 2 -CICS Display definition*

|image2|

*Fig. 3 - CICS Printer Definition*

Note that the characteristics for each device is determined by the
TYpeterm association. For the printer we are using a user defined
Typeterm called IMP3270P.

|image3|

*Fig. 4 - CICS Typeterm definition for the printer*

Within the Typeterm definition the following Operation properties are
set to enable dynamic printer acquirement and release with CICS. The
Typeterm definition is also associated with a Device type of 3270P.

|image4|

*Fig. 5 - CICS Printer Operational Properties*

The CICS application we use is a simple customer inquiry application
which has a print facility. Logging onto the application using Virtel
produces the following messages in the Virtel log.

::

   VIRHT51I HTTP-CLI CONNECTING CLVTA079 TO 192.168.092.056:49318
   VIR0919I CLVTA079 RELAY REHVT000(W2HTP000) ACTIVATED
   VIR0919I CLVTA079 RELAY REHIP000(W2HIP000) ACTIVATED

Message VIRHT51I represents the browser connecting our workstation to
Virtel’s HTTP engine on IP address 192.168.092.056. The two VIR0919I
messages relate to Virtel activating two VTAM applications that will
represent the 3270 display (REHVT000) and printer (REHIP000) to CICS.
The Virtel CICS logon screen looks like this with the Virtel associated
LUs displayed in the bottom right corner.

|image5|

*Fig. 6 - Logging onto CICS*

After logging onto CICS we access the application by entering the
transaction id MENU. This displays a menu list of available options with
the CICS application.

|image6|

*Fig. 7 -CICS Application Menu*

Option 1 is selected to bring up the customer inquiry panel and then a
customer number is entered to bring up the relevant customer detail.

|image7|

*Fig. 8 - Application inquiry display*

PF9 is selected to trigger a print operation. A small print ICON box
appears in the Virtel tool bar on the right hand side and a message
appears in the application notification area indicating that a print
request has been sent to printed id EHS0.

|image8|

*Fig. 9 - Print request acknowledgment*

If we look at the Virtel log we can see the following messages.

::

   VIR0906I SPCICST CONNECTING LUTYPE 00 PRINTER W2HIP000(REHIP000) TO CLVTA079

This indicates that Virtel has received the 3270 print data stream from
CICS. Pressing the Virtel Printer ICON will open and trigger the browser
to display the printer template that Virtel has created within another
browser window.

Note that no pagination and minimal formatting takes place in this print mode.

|image9|

*Fig. 10 - Virtel printo output display*

If we right click and view the source of this template we can see that
Virtel has imbedded pagination tags as required by the CICS transaction.
We can see a page-break-after:always style control associated with a
HTML DIV tag. This will control the pagination when we request a print
of the document.

|image10|

*Fig. 11 - Virtel inserted print formatting controls*

Closing this browser window and then right click and print on the
printer template display will drive the browser printer interface. From
here the printer window will open and we can print the document. The
document is available to print and consists of 3 pages which is what we
would expect. At this point we can of course print the document of even
save it as a PDF.

|image11|

*Fig. 12 - Browser Print Window*

One we have processed the document the browser window will close and we
are returned to the application display. Pressing enter will clear the
print ICON and print message.

|image12|

*Fig. 13 - Pressing enter to clear print request*

**Sharing Virtel printers**

It will often be the case that a Virtel printer will be required to be
shared by 3270 applications. Although CICS has acquired the printer in
the above example another separate application can request that CICS
release the printer so that it can send a print to it. In the following
example we demonstrate GDDM’s ADMPRINT program sending a print to the
REHIP000 printer. The printer terminal state within CICS look like this
after completing the print request in the CICS application.

|image13|

*Fig. 14 - CICS Printer State after printing in CICS*

From within TSO we issue the following commands to drive a GDDM print
request towards REHIP000.

# Allocate the GDDM print queue.

::

   alloc f(ADMPRNTQ) DA(REQUEST.QUEUE) SHR REUSE

# Send a print request.

::

   Call 'gddm.sadmmod(admoprt)' 'gddm.smallprt on rehip000'

Once GDDM determines that there is a pending print request in the queue
it allocates a session with the Virtel printer LU REHIP000 and sends the
output to the printer LU. In our CICS session we again see the ICON
appear in the tool bar, but in this case there is no CICS message
indicating a CICS print request. This is because this request has come
from GDDM and not CICS.

|image14|

*Fig. 15 - Printer Sharing*

In the Virtel log we can see the following messages. This time it is
application GDDMPRTS that is connecting to the printer and not SPCICST.

::

   VIRT906I HTTP-CLI SOCKET 00020000 CALL FROM 192.168.092.056:49408
   VIR0906I GDDMPRTS CONNECTING LUTYPE 00 PRINTER W2HIP000(REHIP000) TO CLVTA079

If we process the print request by selecting the print request ICON,
Virtel will open a new browser window and display the print template.
Within this window we can right click and select print. This will
trigger the browser’s printer support and enable the document to be
processed. Once the print is processed we can close the print browser
template display and press enter on the CICS application display to
indicate that the print request has been processed. This action will
clear the printer ICON from the tool bar display. If we press PF9 again
whilst in the CICS Inquiry menu the Print ICON will again appear
indicating that a print request is available. This demonstrates that
following the GDDM print, CICS has re-acquired the printer LU and can
process further print requests. A Virtel printer LU can be serviced and
shared by other applications.

**Example 2 - SCS printing and PCL.**

Any SCS data stream requires a Virtel input scenario to process the
print request. Virtel will detect a SCS print request type and will
attempt to associate a scenario with that request. Normally, SCS
printing is associated with data streams that have transparent PCL
commands embedded within the data. This, however, may not always be the
case as shown in this example. 3270 print orders can also be handled as
part of a SCS data streams. In this example we will use the same source
data as in the previous example but this time using a SCS destination
printer.

The difference in Virtel behaviour between 3270 printing and SCS
printing is that in 3270 printing Virtel will open a new browser window
and convert the data to a HTML template. In SCS printing the data is
saved in its raw format on disk without any Virtel conversion.

If there is a mismatch between the CICS table definitions and Virtel
then the print request will more than likely fail. For example in the
following scenario we have modified CICS so that printer EHS0 is now a
SCS printer. We did this by executing the following CICS commands.

1. Change the TypeTerm definition from IMP3270P to SCS on the CICS EHS0
   terminal definition.

2. Place EHS0 out of service.

3. Install EHS0.

When will select PF9 from the CICS application Virtel pops up a box
which indicates a print failure. Note that different printer ICON. This
indicates a SCS print.

|image15|

*Fig. 16 - Failed SCS print request*

If we look into the Virtel log we can see the following messages.

::

   VIR0906I SPCICST CONNECTING LUTYPE 01 PRINTER W2HIP000(REHIP000) TO CLVTA079
   VIRC122E ERROR CLVTA079 IS SENDING A SCENARIO PF KEY BUT SCENARIO IS
   MISSING IN TRANSACTION 'CLI-10 ' ENTRY POINT 'CLIWHOST'

Virtel has detected that the print data stream is SCS (LU Type 1) and
that it is connecting this print request to the printer REHIP000 which
is still defined as a 3270 printer in Virtel (Type=P) and not a SCS
printer (Type=S).

If we look at the Virtel Transaction CLI-10 we can see the following
display.

|image16|

*Fig. 17 - Transaction with no input scenario*

We can see that no input scenario is associated this application. SCS
printing will require a scenario. Three scenarios are available:-

1. SCENFPDF Converts SCS data stream into PDF document.

2. SCENFPCL Downloads raw data as a file.

3. SCENPPDF Sends SCS data to external server to be converted to a PDF.
   PDF file is returned to Virtel as an attachment.

Attaching SCENFPCL as an input scenario to the CICS transaction will
enable Virtel to process the print request sent by CICS. We update our
Virtel transaction definition and add the scenario SCENFPCL.

|image17|

*Fig. 18 - Transaction with input scenario*

After restarting Virtel and repeating the print request we are presented
with a dialog box which enables us to save the raw print data stream to
a file of file type PCL.

|image18|

*Fig. 19 - Successful print with SCS*

In the Virtel log we can see the following messages.

::

   VIR0906I SPCICST CONNECTING LUTYPE 01 PRINTER W2HIP000(REHIP000) TO CLVTA079
   VIRT922W HTTP-CLI SOCKET 00010000 ENDED FOR 192.168.092.056:49920
   VIRT906I HTTP-CLI SOCKET 00020000 CALL FROM 192.168.092.056:49938
   APPLHOLT CLVTA079 REHIP000 SCENFPCL DELIVERED DOCUMENT REHIP000-20160510 135830 TO TERMINAL


If we open the downloaded PCL file with an editor we have the following.
Again the pagination will not be respected until we print the file but
Virtel will insert the correct print orders so that the document prints
correctly.

|image19|

*Fig. 20 - SCS Print file*

**Correcting the Virtel definitions for SCS printing**

Although Virtel is intelligent enough to determine that it is receiving
a SCS data stream and overrides the original printer definition for
REHIP000 (LU Type 0) we should correct the Virtel definitions so that
the correct type of printer is defined. In this case a SCS printer type
rather than the overridden 3270 printer type. In Virtel SCS printer
types are defined as TYPE=S. We update the terminal definition
(REHVT000) to associate it with a SCS printer REHIM000. The terminal
display now looks like this.

|image20|

*Fig. 21 - Defining a Virtel SCS printer terminal*

We also have to correct the CICS definition so that the terminal EHS0 is
associated with the Virtel printer definition REHIM000. We use CEDA to
alter and reinstall the terminal. Here is the new CICS table definition.

|image21|

We put the CICS printer EHS0 out of service and then re-install so that
the correct LU name is picked up. A CICS CEMT display now shows this for
CICS terminal EHS0.

|image22|

After updating the terminal definitions and logging onto CICS we can now
see that the display terminal is associated with Virtel printer relay
REHIM000, a Virtel SCS printer. See the bottom right corner.

|image23|

Pressing PF9 initiates a print request as before but this time to the
Virtel LU printer definition REHIM000 which is correctly defined to
Virtel as a SCS printer.

**Virtel Auto-Print Option**

For 3270 printing, Virtel has an auto-print settings option.

|image24|

*Fig. 22 - Auto Print Option*

When selected this has the effect of automatically opening the browsers
printer support window after receiving a print request. You do not have
to right click “print” in the printer template window.

Virtel JES Writer program
=========================

.. note::

    This program is an internal development project and is very much a POC idea. It is not officially supported.

The Virtel JES Writer utility extracts JES2 output and writes to a
Virtel printer relay tasks via a Virtel transaction. The JES output is
converted to a PDF by an input scenario and the PDF can then be printed
or saved at the user’s workstation.

**Installation**

1. Download VJRS.TRS from the Virtel FTP Server.

2. Upload to the mainframe into a dataset with the following DCB
   attributes:-

::

    LRECL=1024,BLKSIZE=6144,RECFM=FB,DSN=HLQ.VJRS.TRS

3. Run the following JCL. This will unterse the file and install the
   VJRS load library. Here is a sample of what I use. Change
   accordingly.

::

    //jobcard JOB 9000,'ED...HOLT...',CLASS=A,MSGCLASS=X,NOTIFY=&SYSUID
    //S01 EXEC PGM=IEFBR14
    //DDA DD UNIT=SYSDA,
    // DSN=HLQ.VJRS.TEMP,DISP=(MOD,DELETE),
    // SPACE=(TRK,0)
    //S02 EXEC PGM=TRSMAIN,PARM=UNPACK
    //SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*
    //INFILE DD DSN=HLQ.VJRS.TRS,DISP=SHR
    //OUTFILE DD UNIT=SYSDA,
    // DSN=HLQ.VJRS.TEMP,DISP=(,CATLG),
    // SPACE=(CYL,(10,10),RLSE)
    //S03 EXEC PGM=ADRDSSU,REGION=0M,COND=(0,NE)
    //SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*
    //IN DD DSN=HLQ.VJRS.TEMP,DISP=SHR
    //OUT DD UNIT=SYSDA,VOL=SER=VVVVVV,DISP=SHR
     RESTORE INDDNAME(IN) -
     OUTDD(OUT) -
     DATASET(INCLUDE(**)) -
     RENAMEU( -
     (SPTHOLT.**,HLQ.**) -
     ) -
     CATALOG BYPASSACS(**) NMC NSC CANCELERROR

4. Authorise the load library. Use the following command:-

::

    SETPROG APF,ADD,DSNAME=hlq.VJRS.LOAD,VOL=vvvvvv

5. Add the following JCL to SYS1.PROCLIB:-

::

    //VJRS PROC MAXTASKS=02
    //STEP1 EXEC PGM=VJES0100,PARM='MAXTASKS=&MAXTASKS'
    //STEPLIB DD DSN=hlq.VJRS.LOAD,DISP=SHR
    //SYSUDUMP DD SYSOUT=*
    //SYSIN DD DSN=SYS1.PARMLIB(VJRSPRNT),DISP=SHR

6. Add the following VTAMLST as member APPLVJRS definition for VJRP:-

::

    APPLVJRS VBUILD TYPE=APPL
    * -----------------------------------------------------------------
    *
    * Product : Virtel Printer *
    * Description : Main ACB for Virtel Printer Application *
    * -----------------------------------------------------------------
    *
    VJRS APPL ACBNAME=VJRS,AUTH=ACQ

7. Add the following configuration statements to SYS1.PARMLIB as member
   VJRSPRNT

::

    *----------------------------------------------------------------------------*
    *- PRINTER CONTROL STATEMETS FOR VJRS UTILITY. -*
    *- -*
    *- COL 1 JES DESTID -*
    *- COL 10 VIRTEL LU RELAY PRINTER -*
    *- COL 19 PRINTER TYPE -*
    *- S = SCS PRINTER. LU TYPE 1 -*
    *----------------------------------------------------------------------------*
    *        *        *
    EDSPRT   REHIM000 S
    EDSPRT1  REHIM001 S
    EDSPRT2  REHIM002 S

8. Concatenate the hlq.VJRS.LOAD to the SERVLIB DD statement in the
   VIRTEL proc.

::

    ......
    //SERVLIB DD DISP=SHR,DSN=hlq.VJRS.LOAD
    // DD DISP=SHR,DSN=hlq.VIRTEL.SERVLIB
    ......

9. Assemble the VJRS scenarios into the VIRTEL load library using the sample hlq.VJRS.SAMPLIB(ASMSCEN). This job assemble the two VJRS
scenarios SCVJRS00 and SCVJRS01 into the VIRTEL loadlib.

**Virtel Configuration**

To use VJRS you must create a transaction(s) in Virtel which provides a
printer interface that converts the JES output to a PDF. This is done by
adding an input scenario to an existing transaction. The input scenario
will convert the JES output to a PDF by calling MAKEPDF through the
$VIRSV interface. In our example we are using the sample scenario
SCVJRS01 which can be found in hlq.VJRS.SAMPLIB. In our case we are
using a TSO transaction as the recipient of the output stream from VJRS.
SCVJRS01 is a scenario that produces landscape print. Scenario SCVJRS00
produces portrait output.

Example of Virtel TSO transaction with PDF input scenario:-

|image0|

**MAKEPDF configuration**

The PDF page format and layout are controlled by text files used by the
ZMAKEPDF program. The following files, found in vjrs.zip distribution
file, must be uploaded to the Virtel W2H directory through the standard
Virtel upload process.

::

    Portrait files
        scenvjrs-docopt.txt
        scenvjrs-layout.txt
        scenvjrs-input.txt

    Landscape files
        scenvjrs-docopt\_l.txt
        scenvjrs-layout\_l.txt
        scenvjrs-input\_l.txt

Details about the format of the files can be found in the *CASI CICS2PDF
Installation and Reference* manual. These files are passed through to
ZMAKEPDF through the calling of the service program VJRS0200. The
service program is invoked from within the scenario by a VIRSV$ call
statement.

**Print controls**

Print control is basic. Any detected ASA control characters are stripped
off and replaced by a blank. Line count is controlled by the
PDF-LINES-PER-PAGE tag.

**Session establishment**

To support printing any 3270 session can be used as long as an associate
printer relay is defined. In my case I am using a TSO session to
establish a printer connection. In the screen shot below a TSO session
has been initiated. The LU associated with this session are REHVT000,
the terminal session, and REHIM000 the printer session. VJRS will
establish a VTAM session with REHIM000. Also, in the URL the transaction
name of TSO1A has been defined. This associates the input scenario
SCVJRS01 with the session.

::

    URL: http://192.168.170.30:41002/w2h/WEB2AJAX.htm+TSO1A

|image1|

Note that there are two VIRTEL relays associated with this session. The
terminal session, REHVT000 and an associated SCS printer relay REHIM000.
The printer relay LU is used by VJRS to transmit the data from JES to
VIRTEL.

**Using VJRS**

1. Activate the VTAM node

    Issue the following z/OS command to activate the VJRS VTAM
    definition:-

::

    V NET,ACT,ID=APPLVJRS

2. Start the VJRS printer tasks

::

    S VJRS

The output from the started task should look like this:-

::

    V NET,INACT,ID=APPLVJRS,I
    IST097I VARY ACCEPTED
    IST105I APPLVJRS NODE NOW INACTIVE
    V NET,ACT,ID=APPLVJRS
    IST097I VARY ACCEPTED
    IST093I APPLVJRS ACTIVE
    S VJRS
    $HASP100 VJRS ON STCINRDR
    IEF695I START VJRS WITH JOBNAME VJRS IS ASSIGNED TO USER START2
    , GROUP SYS1
    $HASP373 VJRS STARTED
    IEF403I VJRS - STARTED - TIME=13.37.47
    VJRS001I - VIRTEL JES WRITER READY

3. Create some output in JES2 by running a batch job. Output should go
   to one of the defined destinations that VJRS is serving. Example
   batch job:-

::

    //SPTHOLTP JOB 'JRPTEST1',CLASS=A,MSGCLASS=Z,NOTIFY=SPTHOLT
    //STEP1 EXEC PGM=IEBGENER
    //SYSPRINT DD DUMMY
    //SYSUT2 DD SYSOUT=A,DEST=EDSPRT
    //SYSUT1 DD DSN=SPTHOLT.VJESPRT.ASM(TESTPRNT),DISP=SHR
    //SYSIN DD DUMMY


.. note::
    
    The MSGCLASS=Z ensures that only the Class A output is left on
    the JES queue with an associated destination of EDSPRT for the
    submitted job.

4. After the job has run, output will appear on JES with a DESTID of
   EDSPRT. This will be captured by VJRS, via the JES2 SAPI interface,
   and sent to the associated Virtel LU relay. In this case LU REHIM000

5. Virtel will indicate that Print Output is available by presenting the
   user with a Printer ICON in the Operator Interface Area or Taskbar on
   the Virtel Terminal screen.

    |image2|

    Pressing the printer ICON will kick off the input scenario SCENFPDF
    which will convert the output to a PDF and then issue the ADOBE
    option window to open or save the file.

    Select the printer ICON and the input scenario will drive the
    “MAKEPDF” program which will convert the output to a PDF.

    |image3|

    From here the user can open or save the PDF. In our example we
    choose to open the PDF.

    |image4|

    Once you have finished with the PDF close the window and the Virtel
    Print Notification dialog. Note that you are still left with the
    Printer ICON in the taskbar. This enables you to reopen the print if
    required. Once you press Enter or initiate another application
    action (PFx) the Printer Icon will disappear and the Virtel session
    is now ready for the next print request.

**Using VJRS and VIRTEL message log off load**

In Virtel 4.54 (not available until 2015/Q1) the LOG feature enables
the VIRTEL log to be spun off to JES2. VJRS can capture the log from
JES2 and send it directly to the LU relay printer and in the process
convert it to a PDF.

Setting up VIRTEL to use the LOG sysout facility requires a change
to the TCT definition to direct WTOs to a SYSOUT dataset. In the TCT
code the following statement:-

::    

    LOG=(SYSOUT,class,destination)

For example, LOG=(SYSOUT,A,EDSPRT)

This directs all WTOs to a SYSOUT dataset rather than the system
console log (SYSLOG). If you want WTO messages going to both the
system console and a SYSOUT dataset than issue the following VIRTEL
command:-

::

    F VIRTEL,LOG=BOTH

The LOG feature in Virtel 4.54 is controlled by the TCT parameters
and a new LOG command. The new LOG command has the following
format:-

::

    F VIRTEL,LOG=CONSOLE \| SYSOUT \| BOTH \| SPIN

- LOG=CONSOLE routes all WTO message to the system console. This isthe default action.

- LOG=SYSOUT routes all WTO messages to a VIRTEL SYSOUT dataset whichis dynamically allocated.

- LOG=BOTH routes all WTO messages to both the system console and a dynamically allocated SYSOUT dataset.

- LOG=SPIN forces Virtel to release the current SYSOUT dataset for further processing and allocates a new SYSOUT dataset.

Virtel will direct messages to an allocated SYSOUT data set and | or the console (default). If SYSOUT processing is being used you
will see a dynamically allocated dataset in the SDSF display panel.

Issue a “?” next to the VIRTEL started task.

|image5|

Here we can see that VIRTEL has allocated a DDNAME SYS00001. If we
select this dataset in SDSF we can see that it is the VIRTEL message
log that would normally be written to the system console log.

|image6|

Assuming that VJRS is running, if we spin this dataset off using the
LOG=SPIN command, VIRTEL will release the SYSOUT dataset to JES2.
VJRS will then capture it and send it to its destination which is
EDSPRT. EDSPRT just happens to be the relay LU defined in VIRTEL and
associated with the printer REHIM000.

In the VIRTEL 3270 session issue the command:-

::

    F VIRTEL,LOG=SPIN

In the top right of the VIRTEL window, next to the language
indicator, a printer box will appear:-

|image7|

Pressing the printer icon will process the capture message log from
VIRTEL and convert it to a PDF file through MAKEPDF. The PDF file
will then be display. The message log can then be saved as a PDF
file.

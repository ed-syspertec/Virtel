VIR0T09

Meaning
-------

VIRTEL has opened TCP/IP socket socknum on the line with external name
linename. If socknum is 00000000 then this is a listening socket, port
is the listening port number, and ipaddr is the IP address on which
VIRTEL accepts incoming connections (000.000.000.000 means that VIRTEL
accepts connections on any of the host’s home IP addresses). If socknum
is non-zero and port is non-zero, then this is an incoming connection,
and ipaddr:port is the client’s IP address and port number. If socknum
is non-zero and port is 00000, then this is an outgoing connection, and
ipaddr is VIRTEL’s IP address (000.000.000.000 means that VIRTEL is
using the host’s default home address). For VIRTEL 4.33 onwards, this
message is replaced by messages VIRT905I, VIRT906I and VIRT907I
respectively. This message can be suppressed by the SILENCE parameter in
the VIRTCT.
